# Installers

This is a collection (currently having just one member :)) of Wix Toolset installers
which use the Wix.SimpleUI framework I wrote.

You can learn more about the Wix Toolset at http://wixtoolset.org/. But I also
highly recommend you buy Wix 3.6: A Developer's Guide, by Nick Ramirez. Because
the Wix Toolset has a steep learning curve.

You can find the Wix.SimpleUI framework at https://github.com/markolbert/Wix.SimpleUI.
